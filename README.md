# First steps into WebSockets

These are my first steps into WebSockets,  following @CodingGarden livestream.  

**Client**  
- The client just receives a prompt to enter its name. Then the server sends a list of all clients to all the clients connected.

**Server**  
- The server just opens connections to several clients.
- Features a rudimentary IP validation to block connections from the same remote address.
